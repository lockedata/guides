# README
- Ensure the use of non-RECON user friendly language, try not to refer to internal processes etc. 
- Incude a clearly defined workflow and justification for using the package
  - Include an elevator pitch and examples of where and why the package has been used - this all improves trust for the user.
    - E.g. "Youâ€™re in DRC, have low internet connection, are working on X situation..."
  
# Contributing Guidelines
- Contributing guidelines should be included in each package repo, there is a good example at `reportfactory/CONTRIBUTING.md`.
  
# Issue  and Pull Request Templates
- Issue and PR templates should be included in each package repo, there is a good example at `reportfactory/.github`.

**Guidelines and templates all improve the chances of you having a more manageable workload and a great relationship with helpful contributors!** 

# Tests
- Tests should be written prior to the code.
- Basic tests should test defaults first and foremost.
- Test coverage should be as comprehensive as possible

# Functions
- Follow the coding rules in the `golden_rules` document
- Functions should be clearly commented 
- Internal functions should be tagged as so
- Commented out code should be removed to improve readability.
- All fucntions both internal and external should have roxygen documentation
  - As a minimum internal functions should include a context e.g. #' This function is designed to...

- Avoid using personal/colloquial language when writing comments and context - non-RECON users need to understand too.

- Examples for functions should appear in the roxygen comments rather than the README

# Final checks 
- devtools::check()
* R CMD should pass

- goodpractise::gp()

- lintr::lint_package()
* Remove trailing white spaces 

- devtools::spell_check() 
* Catch spelling errors
