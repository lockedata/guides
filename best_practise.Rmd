This is a high-level checklist for RECON packages that is backed by the broader information included in [rOpenSci Packages: Development, Maintenance, and Peer Review](https://devguide.ropensci.org/) and [R Packages: Organize, Test, Document, and Share Your Code](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/). Fundamentally, we want to write packages that people can use to support their work and make an impact. Our "audience" includes people with different levels of R skill and time to learn how to use a package so most of our guidelines are about helping you thinking about how you can make your package robust, error free, and accessible.

# Package contents
## README
- Ensure the use of non-RECON user friendly language, try not to refer to internal processes etc. 
- Incude a clearly defined workflow and justification for using the package
  - Include an elevator pitch and examples of where and why the package has been used - this all improves trust for the user.
    - E.g. "Youâ€™re in DRC, have low internet connection, are working on X situation..."

## Functions
- Follow the coding rules in the `golden_rules` document
- Functions should be clearly commented 
- Internal functions should be tagged as so
- Commented out code should be removed to improve readability.
- All functions both internal and external should have roxygen documentation
  - As a minimum internal functions should include a context e.g. #' This function is designed to...
- Avoid using personal/colloquial language when writing comments and context - non-RECON users need to understand too.
- Examples for functions should appear in the roxygen comments rather than the README

## Tests
- Tests should be written prior to the code.
- Basic tests should test defaults first and foremost.
- Test coverage should be as comprehensive as possible

## Quality checks
Use packages like {devtools}, {lintr}, and {goodpractice} to ensure your code passes quality checks, correct spellings, and meets common formatting standards.

```r
devtools::check()
goodpractice::gp()
lintr::lint_package()
devtools::spell_check() 
```

# Collaboration
  
## Contributing Guidelines
- Contributing guidelines should be included in each package repo, there is a good example at `reportfactory/CONTRIBUTING.md`.
  
## Issue and Pull Request Templates
- Issue and PR templates should be included in each package repo, there is a good example at `reportfactory/.github`.

**Guidelines and templates all improve the chances of you having a more manageable workload and a great relationship with helpful contributors!**
